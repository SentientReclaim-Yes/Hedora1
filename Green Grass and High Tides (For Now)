Green Grass and High Tides (For Now)

How wildly thematic :

So there I was, Midpoint Upon The Journey of Our (Most Bodacious) Lives, see -

I find myself within the struggle of this|here Dark Forest, man -

Hostilities upon all sides, at all hours, at behest to my|our very fuckin’ souls and dosh, my cat -

& The Flag Upon Our Moon Compels Me To Squawk -

For the Straightforward Pathway Had Been (Loooooong) Lost, ya dig? -

Where you read this is not where you can find me ~ Imagine This akin to a Packet set needlessly adrift the ebs and flows of the Internet Super Highway. Will this be found? Who finds this – Will they appreciate the goofy but deep takes and think to themselves “Dang – Gost ta get me som moah of dis!” 

Then I have luck for you! More is on the way!

And that’s it. 

Much like previous Mythic Figures – I come and go as I please, never arriving late nor early – Like the Polar Bear to any lost, supple Adventurers, learning over a snowdune, bloody and fucked up from a recent kill, the eyes of a merciless God, silently roaring to the countryside soon to be previously containing villagers – jus poppin’ in to remind y’all I’m Here – Right On Time - 

And I Will Come Again
